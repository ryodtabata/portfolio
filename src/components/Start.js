        How It All Started..

      <h3>
        I was beaten by a friend in chess once. Once. He was a computer science student I met in my first year of 
        university while I was studying Bio-Chemistry. He created a bot that outplayed me. This changed everything. Fast forward 4 years I am about to complete
        my final term at the University of Victoria with a degree in Computer Sceince; Software Systems. I am very thankful for 
        that chess bot; computer science has allowed me to bring my creative ideas to life to share with all of you.
