          I was beaten by a friend in chess once. Once. He was a computer science student I met during my first year of 
          university while I was studying Bio-Chemistry. He created a bot that outplayed me. This changed everything.

        <p className="start-description">
          Fast forward four years, I am about to complete my final term at the University of Victoria with a degree in 
          Computer Science: Software Systems. I am very thankful for that chess bot; computer science has allowed me 
          to bring my creative ideas to life and share them with all of you.
